This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug related to dynamically adding content to a non-existent element using innerHTML. The bug occurs when attempting to modify the content of an element that hasn't been fully parsed or rendered by the browser.  This often happens when the script attempting to modify the element is placed before the element declaration in the HTML. The solution provides a way to ensure that the element exists before attempting to modify it, using event listeners or placing the script at the end of the document body.
